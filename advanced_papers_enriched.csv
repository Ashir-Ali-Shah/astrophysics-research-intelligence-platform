2510.08514v1,Effects of dark dipole radiation on eccentric supermassive black hole   binary inspirals,"The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation, and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.","Mu-Chun Chen, Yan Cao",2025,2025-10-09,"['gr-qc', 'astro-ph.CO', 'astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.HE', 'hep-ph']",gr-qc,arXiv,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08514v1,arXiv,2510.08514v1,27,-1,0,0.0,"['theoretical', 'statistical', 'spectroscopic']","['black_hole', 'neutron_star']","[('supermassive black hole', 0.242535625036333), ('black hole', 0.242535625036333), ('dipole radiation', 0.242535625036333), ('supermassive black', 0.242535625036333), ('hole binary', 0.16169041669088866)]",False,0,27.0
2510.08505v1,AT 2018cow at ~5 years: additional evidence for a tidal disruption   origin,"The Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT 2018cow is the prototype of its class with an extensive set of multi-wavelength observations. Despite a rich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and origin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the explosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely from an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the optical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV data points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk models, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low mass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides evidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal decay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by interacting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission and interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even later times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellar material.","Anne Inkenhaag, Andrew J.

2510.08472v1,Agnostic Product Mixed State Tomography via Robust Statistics,"We consider the problem of agnostic tomography with \emph{mixed state} ansatz, and specifically, the natural ansatz class of product mixed states. In more detail, given $N$ copies of an $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which is $\epsilon$-close to a product mixed state $\pi$, the goal is to output a nearly-optimal product mixed state approximation to $\rho$. While there has been a flurry of recent work on agnostic tomography, prior work could only handle pure state ansatz, such as product states or stabilizer states. Here we give an algorithm for agnostic tomography of product mixed states which finds a product state which is $O(\epsilon \log 1 / \epsilon)$ close to $\rho$ which uses polynomially many copies of $\rho$, and which runs in polynomial time. Moreover, our algorithm only uses single-qubit, single-copy measurements. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm that achieves any non-trivial agnostic tomography guarantee for any class of mixed state ansatz.   Our algorithm proceeds in two main conceptual steps, which we believe are of independent interest. First, we demonstrate a novel, black-box efficient reduction from agnostic tomography of product mixed states to the classical task of \emph{robustly learning binary product distributions} -- a textbook problem in robust statistics. We then demonstrate a nearly-optimal efficient algorithm for the classical task of robustly learning a binary product, answering an open problem in the literature. Our approach hinges on developing a new optimal certificate of closeness for binary product distributions that can be leveraged algorithmically via a carefully defined convex relaxation. Finally, we complement our upper bounds with a lower bound demonstrating that adaptivity is information-theoretically necessary for our agnostic tomography task, so long as the algorithm only uses single-qubit two-outcome projective measurements.","Alvan Arulandu, Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel Kane et al.",2025,2025-10-09,['quant-ph'],quant-ph,arXiv,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08472v1,arXiv,2510.08472v1,13,-1,0,1.0,"['theoretical', 'experimental', 'computational']",[],"[('agnostic tomography', 0.34992710611188255), ('product mixed', 0.34992710611188255), ('mixed state', 0.29160592175990213), ('product mixed state', 0.17496355305594127), ('binary product', 0.17496355305594127)]",False,0,13.0

This artwork, Airy, asks whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric (who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping), and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state.

2510.08375v1,"Primordial Black Holes, Charge, and Dark Matter: Rethinking Evaporation   Limits","Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter.

In this study, we introduce Mephisto -- a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree search, accumulates knowledge through self-play, and dynamically updates its knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations -- including the James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered ""Little Red Dot"" galaxies -- we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices.

This gauged supergravity can be obtained from the maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions on a Riemann surface.

We study holographic RG flow solutions describing deformations of this SCFT by turning on relevant, marginal and irrelevant operators to $N=2$ non-conformal phases in the IR. Solutions describing conformal interfaces between these non-conformal phases and singular boundaries are also given. We finally study a number of supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black string and black hole solutions holographically dual to RG flows across dimensions from the $N=2$ SCFT to two-dimensional SCFTs and superconformal quantum mechanics in the IR.

2510.08231v1,Explanation of the Mass Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers,"Gravitational wave detectors are observing an increasing number of binary black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing a bimodal mass distribution of BBHs, which hints at diverse formation histories for these systems. Using the rapid binary population synthesis code MOBSE, we simulate a series of population synthesis models that include chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By considering metallicity-specific star formation and selection effects, we compare the intrinsic merger rates and detection rates of each model with observations. We find that the observed peaks in the mass distribution of merging BBHs at the low-mass end (10\msun) and the high-mass end (35\msun) are contributed by the common envelope channel or stable mass transfer channel (depending on the stability criteria for mass transfer) and the CHE channel, respectively, in our model. The merger rates and detection rates predicted by our model exhibit significant sensitivity to the choice of physical parameters.

While it is well established that the full theory consistently propagates three degrees of freedom, we confirm that its linearised spectrum around Minkowski spacetime is empty. moreover, we show that this is not a feature unique to Minkowski spacetime, but a generic property of all traceless-Ricci spacetimes that have a vanishing Ricci scalar, such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The mechanism for this phenomenon is a change in the nature of the constraints upon linearisation: ten second-class constraints of the full theory become first-class, while the three momentum constraints degenerate into a single constraint. Furthermore, we show that higher order perturbation theory around these singular backgrounds reveals no degrees of freedom at any order. This is in conflict with the general analysis and points to the fact that such backgrounds are surfaces of strong coupling in field space, where the dynamics of perturbations becomes nonperturbative. We further show via a cosmological phase-space analysis that the evolving universe is able to penetrate through the singular $R=0$ surface.","Will Barker, Dražen Glavan",2025,2025-10-09,"['gr-qc', 'hep-th']",gr-qc,arXiv,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08201v1,arXiv,2510.08201v1,19,-1,0,0.5,"['theoretical', 'spectroscopic']",['black_hole'],"[('degrees freedom', 0.19156525704423027), ('minkowski spacetime', 0.19156525704423027), ('ricci scalar', 0.19156525704423027), ('vanishing ricci', 0.09578262852211514), ('pure gravity hamiltonian', 0.09578262852211514)]",False,0,19.0

First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law.

2510.08105v1,The influence of the mean anomaly on the dynamical quantities of binary   black hole mergers in eccentric orbits,"In studies of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in eccentric orbits, the mean anomaly, traditionally regarded as less significant than eccentricity, has been thought to encode only the orbital phase, leading to the assumption that it exerts minimal influence on the dynamics of eccentric mergers. In a previous investigation, we identified consistent oscillations in dynamical quantities peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in relation to the initial eccentricity $e_0$. These oscillations are associated with integer orbital cycles within a phenomenological framework. In this paper, we aim to explore the underlying physical nature of these oscillations through gravitational waveforms. Our examination of remnant mass and spin reveals that while the initial ADM mass $M_{\mathrm{ADM}}$ and orbital angular momentum $L_0$ exhibit gradual variations with $e_0$, the radiated energy $E_{\text{rad}}$ and angular momentum $L_{\text{rad}}$ display oscillatory patterns akin to those observed in $M_{\text{rem}}$ and $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$. By decomposing the waveforms into three distinct phases inspiral, late inspiral to merger, and ringdown, we demonstrate that these oscillations persist across all phases, suggesting a common origin. Through a comparative analysis of $E_{\text{rad}}$ and $L_{\text{rad}}$ derived from numerical relativity (NR), post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes during the inspiral phase, we identify the initial mean anomaly $l_0$ as the source of the observed oscillations. ...","Hao Wang, Bin Liu, Yuan-Chuan Zou et al.",2025,2025-10-09,"['gr-qc', 'astro-ph.HE']",gr-qc,"Phys.

This study investigates the optical Kerr effect (OKE) enhancement in high-refractive-index metasurfaces featuring non-BIC trapped-mode resonances, using gallium phosphide (GaP) as a model material. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations reveal a significant enhancement of the effective second-order refractive index, reaching values up to 700 times greater than bulk GaP. The numerical results show strong electromagnetic field localization at the trapped-mode resonance, characterized by a wide transmittance dip (low Q-factor) and near-unity reflectance. Remarkable stability is observed, with the OKE enhancement maintaining less than 5\% variation for moderate polarization angles and tolerating random nanohole rotations that model fabrication imperfections.

2510.08067v1,Towards Real-World Deepfake Detection: A Diverse In-the-wild Dataset of   Forgery Faces,"Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media. While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9 commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found ""in the wild"", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover, RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators. Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain, intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared to conventional datasets.

However, existing learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.","Moon Ye-Bin, Roy Miles, Tae-Hyun Oh et al.",2025,2025-10-09,['cs.CV'],cs.CV,arXiv,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08054v1,arXiv,2510.08054v1,18,-1,4,0.5,"['experimental', 'computational']",[],"[('image retouching', 0.2553769592276246), ('white box image', 0.17025130615174972), ('retouchllm training free', 0.17025130615174972), ('training free', 0.17025130615174972), ('training free white', 0.17025130615174972)]",False,0,18.0
2510.08014v1,Gate Voltage Tunable Second Harmonic Generation in Mono- and Bi-layer   Black Phosphene,"Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.","Yan Meng, Kainan Chang, Yanyan Qian et al.",2025,2025-10-09,['cond-mat.mes-hall'],cond-mat.mes-hall,arXiv,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08014v1,arXiv,2510.08014v1,23,-1,2,1.0,"['theoretical', 'spectroscopic']",[],"[('gate voltage', 0.36661778755338326), ('electric field', 0.2932942300427066), ('second harmonic', 0.21997067253202995), ('second order', 0.1466471150213533), ('order nonlinear', 0.1466471150213533)]",False,0,23.0
2510.08003v1,CIR-CoT: Towards Interpretable Composed Image Retrieval via End-to-End   Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,"Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes."" This inherent opacity not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption, reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset, establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems.","Weihuang Lin, Yiwei Ma, Jiayi Ji et al.",2025,2025-10-09,['cs.CV'],cs.CV,arXiv,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08003v1,arXiv,2510.08003v1,17,-1,4,0.25,"['theoretical', 'experimental']",[],"[('cir cot', 0.34299717028501764), ('language models', 0.17149858514250882), ('chain thought', 0.17149858514250882), ('composed image', 0.17149858514250882), ('composed image retrieval', 0.17149858514250882)]",False,0,17.0
2510.07982v1,Hot-carrier generation in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles,"Energetic electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles can be harnessed in nanoscale devices for photocatalysis, photovoltaics or sensing. In this work, we study the generation of such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and Cu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale quantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus nanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the spectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under solar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation rate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant increase in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size. This is caused by a dramatic enhancement of the electric field in the neck region. We also study the dependence of hot-carrier generation on the light polarization and find that the largest generation rates are obtained when the electric field is perpendicular to the interface between the two metals due to the maximal dipole coupling with the electric field. The insights from our study will guide the experimental design of efficient hot-carrier devices based on bimetallic Janus nanoparticles.","Hanwen Jin, Chengcheng Xiao, Matias Herran et al.",2025,2025-10-09,"['physics.optics', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci']",physics.optics,arXiv,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07982v1,arXiv,2510.07982v1,19,-1,0,1.0,"['theoretical', 'experimental', 'spectroscopic']",[],"[('hot carrier', 0.411113225896519), ('janus nanoparticles', 0.34259435491376583), ('carrier generation', 0.27407548393101266), ('hot carrier generation', 0.27407548393101266), ('bimetallic janus', 0.2055566129482595)]",False,0,19.0
2510.07973v1,Magnetic-Field Control of Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquids in Ta2Pd3Te5 Edge   States,"Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly tunable.Theory and early experiments have already identified a wealth of emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge, and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore, rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based quantum devices.","Xingchen Guo Anqi Wang, Xiutong Deng, Yupeng Li et al.",2025,2025-10-09,"['cond-mat.mes-hall', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci']",cond-mat.mes-hall,arXiv,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07973v1,arXiv,2510.07973v1,21,-1,2,1.0,"['theoretical', 'experimental']",[],"[('zeeman gap', 0.26413527189768715), ('tomonaga luttinger', 0.17609018126512477), ('reversal symmetry', 0.17609018126512477), ('time reversal symmetry', 0.17609018126512477), ('time reversal', 0.17609018126512477)]",True,0,21.0

A choice of $\mu=0.3$ gurantees a single horizon with unrestricted magnetic charge $q$. The onset scalarization of this black hole appears for a positive coupling $\alpha$ with an unlimited magnetic charge $q$.

2510.07952v1,Spin-Orbit Misalignments of Eccentric Black Hole Mergers in AGN Disks,"The disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a natural environment where stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can dynamically pair, undergo repeated interactions, and eventually merge. It is commonly assumed that gas accretion will both efficiently spin up disk-embedded black holes and align the orbits of embedded binaries with the disk plane, leading to mergers with preferentially positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Such predictions have motivated the use of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a diagnostic for identifying candidate AGN-embedded mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave catalog. In this work, we perform post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations of nearly planar binary-single encounters and apply an empirically motivated, gas-driven alignment prescription to characterize the expected $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$-eccentricity correlations of AGN-embedded mergers. By comparing the alignment and gravitational-wave inspiral timescales, we identify the regions of parameter space, across both disk location and binary properties, where full disk-spin-orbit alignment is effective and where it is not. We find that quasi-circular binaries typically align by the time they merge, supporting the standard picture of spin-orbit aligned orientations. By contrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity $e_{10\mathrm{Hz}}\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques to act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding more isotropic $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and torque efficiencies are modest. This interplay naturally establishes a correlation between binary eccentricity and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in AGN disks, highlighting a new key observable of the AGN channel and a potential explanation for massive events such as GW190521 and GW231123.","Gaia Fabj, Christopher Tiede, Connar Rowan et al.",2025,2025-10-09,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.GA']",astro-ph.HE,arXiv,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07952v1,arXiv,2510.07952v1,16,-1,0,1.0,['theoretical'],"['galaxy', 'star', 'black_hole']","[('chi_ mathrm', 0.34421419541075715), ('chi_ mathrm eff', 0.34421419541075715), ('mathrm eff', 0.34421419541075715), ('spin orbit', 0.2753713563286057), ('embedded mergers', 0.13768567816430285)]",False,0,16.0
